### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Dev Lead for a Government Organisation in Australia, a member of [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Core Team.

I spend most of my time working on CycloneDX. But I'm also a maintainer of [dotnet-outdated](https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated), and a bunch of other small projects.
