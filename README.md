### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Dev Lead for a Government Organisation in Australia, an OWASP member and member of the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Core Team.

I spend most of my time working on CycloneDX. But I'm also a maintainer of [dotnet-outdated](https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated), a [docker image for the open source NGINX WAF](https://github.com/coderpatros/docker-nginx-waf) and a bunch of other small projects.

If you get value out of what I do, and want to show your support, please head over to my [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/coderpatros).
