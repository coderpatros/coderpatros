### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Dev Lead for a Government Organisation in Australia, an OWASP member and part of the [CycloneDX](https://github.com/CycloneDX/) Core Team.

I also maintain a fork of the abandoned [dotnet-outdated tool](https://github.com/coderpatros/dotnet-outdated), a docker image for the open source [NGINX WAF](https://github.com/coderpatros/docker-nginx-waf) (which uses [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) and the [OWASP CRS](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/)) and a bunch of other small projects.

If you get value out of what I do, and want to show your support, please head over to my [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/coderpatros).
